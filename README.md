## Credits

The Conceptual Data Models were prepared using the community edition of the  [ERwin](http://erwin.com/products/data-modeler/community-edition) Data Modeler.

**Note:** The community edition of ERwin is limited to 25 model objects, to address this limitation each subject area (e.g., Party, Location, Product) model is located in a separate '.erwin' file.
